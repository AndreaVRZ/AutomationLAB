For both logics it is given the code related to the Real Plant and the one related to 
Simulation (CoDeSys Visualization).                                                   
The only differences between these files is that in the CoDeSys Visualization version 
the I/O signal are linked with the graphical GUI elements.                            
As consequence in the Real Plant version the code lines associated to the sensors and 
actuators simulation are commented.                                                   
Obviously the PLC configuration regards only the Real Plant files.
